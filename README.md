# 3D LUT Generator

If you don't know what a 3D LUT is -> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_lookup_table

The tool allows a user (e.g. image tuning engineer, designer, camera developer) to adjust an imaging device (e.g. camera imaging processor, GPU) by importing an image frame and performing various image tuning operations on it. Once he is pleased with the result, he can export the 3D LUT (a text file), which can then be imported wherever it is needed as part of a larger image calibration process.

Of course, this is just a prototype...
